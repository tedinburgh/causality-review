## These are the instructions for regenerating Figure 3 of our paper
## from scratch, and all other figures from existing .csv files.
## To regenerate all the data from scratch would take approximately 
## 60 hours, so we have selected Figure 3 to reproduce as this is the 
## quickest.
##
## Requirements
##
## Anaconda with Python (at least 3.8.3).


## Steps

## Clone the repository (It is expected that the following steps have
## already been performed. If you have not already cloned the
## repository but you have this script, you can add these two lines 
## back in and then run this script, though we advise cloning the 
## repository first.## repository first.## repository first.)
 
# git clone https://github.com/tedinburgh/causality-review
# cd causality-review

## To run our code, you will need python 3.8.3 at least together
## with extra packages; these are installed into a virtual environment:

conda create --name causality_test --file requirements.txt
conda activate causality_test

## Before running the simulations, we first remove the stored
## data files (Linear process) and figures.

rm simulation-data/lp_*.csv
cp figures/methods_paper.eps .
rm figures/*
cp methods_paper.eps figures/

## The following job takes about 3 hours on a modern linux machine.
time python causality-review-code/model_simulations.py --sim lp

## The following job can take up to about 15 minutes on a modern linux machine.
time python causality-review-code/misc_ci.py

## At the end, to close the virtual environment, you can simply do:

conda deactivate
