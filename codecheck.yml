    comment: Figure 2 in paper. Note, there is a warning message about image transparency but this does not change output. The following warnings are also expected: 'RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice', 'RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater', 'RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less'.

    comment: Figure 3 in paper. Note, there is a warning message about image transparency but this does not change output.

    comment: Figure 4a in paper. Note, there is a warning message about image transparency but this does not change output. The following warnings are also expected: 'RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice', 'RuntimeWarning: Degrees of freedom <= 0 for slice'.

    comment: Figure 4b in paper. Note, there is a warning message about image transparency but this does not change output. The following warnings are also expected: 'RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice', 'RuntimeWarning: Degrees of freedom <= 0 for slice'.

    comment: Table III in paper (LaTex code). Note, small errors in arXiv submission (v1) for TE(H)/TE(KSG) Baseline column, plus for NLGC/CCM in the final three columns. This will be corrected in arXiv submission (v2) and paper submission imminently. The following warning is also expected: 'RuntimeWarning: Degrees of freedom <= 0 for slice'.

    comment: Table S.II in paper (LaTex code). This will not be reproduced exactly, as it represents measured execution times.
